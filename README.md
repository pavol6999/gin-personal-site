Personal project for learning GO as a backend application

## What is the purpose of this project?


The objectives of this project can be divided into four distinct sub-goals, each focusing on a specific aspect. These sub-goals are:

1. Learn Go as a programming language, including best practice and niche features of the language.

Go is a dominant language alongside Python while dealing with cloud and containers. Gaining more knowledge about the language will help me understand how the underlying structure of the infrastructure functions and would help me with analysing source code of most trending applications written in Go such as Docker, Argo, Terraform operators etc.

2. Gather more knowledge about backend services and applications following the Twelve-Factor methodology.

I strongly believe that in order to pose as a cloud engineer tasked with decreasing the turnover time of features coming to production environment and increasing the flow of changes that the system can handle, we must get acquantied with the developers work and know at least broadly the most occurring problems and issues in applications and how applications developed.

3. Learn about nice-to-have tools and standards while creating new projects.

Each time we create a new project, we create some boilerplate alongisde with it. Everybody knows about README files and dot files to configure the repository. I would like to gain knowledge about most of helper tools to have an overview about what tool is good to use. In other words, the idea is that this repository will also serve as a template from which I will create a script that I can use, to bootstrap new projects.

E.g. When you would like to create a new project, you will call the script and it will configure the folder with the correct files. Add generic pipelines for static code testing, create dotfiles, project structure and many more!

4. Have fun!

## Purpose of the application

No purpose at all. It may well be just a generic application with no business usage whatsoever, or it may turn out to be a backend for my personal site. The main part here is to gain knowledge on the process and not on the features of the application written in Go.
